# Contributing to PETucation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PETucation! This project aims to create an educational and interactive experience for children to learn about pet care through various minigames. Below are some ideas on how you can contribute to this project. We welcome all levels of contributions, from code improvements to new content ideas.

## Improving Existing Features

### 1. Enhance the Pet Dog Experience

- **Reduce Lags in the "Walk" Minigame:** Improve the performance and responsiveness of the dog-walking minigame. This could involve optimizing the code, improving the handling of events, or similar.
- **Integrate Learning into the Reward System:** Enhance the reward system (dragging bone to the dog) by incorporating statements that reinforce what the user learned in the previous minigame. For example, after walking the dog, the mascot could explain, "It's important to use a leash to keep your dog safe and under control" or "We need to pick up after our dog to keep our environment clean and protect other animals and people."
- **Implement Advanced Animations:** Enhance the user experience by developing more advanced animations for the onboarding and offboarding.

### 2. Add New Minigames for the Pet Dog

- **Teaching Commands Minigame:** Implement a new minigame where the player can teach the dog commands like "sit," "stay," or "fetch." This could be an interactive way for kids to learn about dog training.
- **Tick Removal Minigame:** Create a minigame where players learn how to safely remove ticks from a dog. This could be an important lesson in pet care, teaching kids the importance of checking their pets for ticks and how to deal with them properly.

## Expanding the Project

### 1. Implement a New Pet: The Cat

- **Develop a Cat Character:** Create a new pet character, such as a cat, with its own unique set of minigames. Think of a storyline that teaches kids about caring for cats—such as feeding, grooming, or understanding cat behavior.
- **New Cat Minigames Ideas:**
  - **Grooming:** Teach kids the importance of brushing a cat's fur to prevent matting and reduce shedding.
  - **Litter Training:** A minigame where kids learn how to set up and clean a litter box, teaching them the basics of cat hygiene.
  - **Understanding Cat Behavior:** A game that helps kids recognize when a cat is playful, hungry, or in need of some quiet time.

## General Improvements

- **Accessibility Features:** Add features to make the game more accessible to children with disabilities, such as options for colorblind users or narrated instructions for visually impaired players.
- **Refactor Code:** Review the existing codebase for potential improvements in readability, efficiency, and maintainability. This could involve restructuring code, adding comments, or updating dependencies.
- **Improve Documentation:** Enhance the existing documentation to make it easier for new contributors to understand the project structure and start contributing. This could include updating the README file, adding more detailed setup instructions, or creating tutorials.
