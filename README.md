# Schule 4.0 - PETucation

**PETucation** is a web application aimed at teaching first graders how to care for pets responsibly through fun, interactive mini-games. It enhances learning by providing a hands-on experience rather than just reading or listening. The children are guided by Lisa, a virtual mascot, who helps them through the tasks and ensures they can easily follow along with voice instructions.
